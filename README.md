## Introduction

Since its introduction, CSS has never had an official logo. Only eversince CSS3 and therefore the well known shields got introduced people had a visual representation in terms of a logo when they were talking about CSS.

For well over a decade now this shield served as logo for the CSS language, but whilst CSS evolved and more and more features got added the shield with it's big 3 in the middle stayed the same.

Whilst investigating new ways for how to proper version CSS to better visualize the evolution of the language the CSS-Next Community Group, in addition to the [new CSS levels](https://github.com/CSS-Next/css-next/discussions/92), started working on a newly more generalized logo that can represents CSS as a whole rather than only version 3.

Together with the community the CSS Community Group started [collecting ideas for a new logo](https://github.com/CSS-Next/css-next/issues/105) and started working on improving some of the drafts that had been made. After After quite a few itterations this is the final result.

## Logo Usage Guidelines

The logo is released under a MIT license so you use it as you want. Nevertheless the CSS-Next Community Group decided upon providing usage guidlines to make sure the logo is used in an accessible and recognizable manner.

### Font

The logo uses [**Dinish Condensed Heavy**](https://github.com/playbeing/dinish) as font for the letters as well as digits presented.
The font is open source and free to use. The numbers have been slightly adjusted to match the overall logo, therefore we advice you to only use the offical logos provided by the CSS Next Community Group inside of this repository to keep the logo recognizable across different sources.

### Colors

The logo comes in three main colorways so it can be used in any scenario.

#### Main

This is the main logo colorway. It uses pinkish `#E5007C` as background color and white `#FFFFFF` as font color.

#### Dark

The dark colorway of the logo. It uses black `#000000` as background color and white `#FFFFFF` as font color. This logo should only be used on light backgrounds to ensure accessibility.

#### Light

The light colorway of the logo. It uses white `#FFFFFF` as background color and black `#000000` as font color. This logo should only be used on dark backgrounds to ensure accessibility.

### Background

Use neutral, light, or dark colors that maintain at least **AAA WCAG contrast** with the logo. Avoid using the logo on overly busy or complex backgrounds that reduce its legibility or fail to meet the contrast standards.

### Clear Space and Sizing

Maintain a clear space around the logo to preserve its integrity. This space should be at least equal to half the height of the logo.
The minimum size of the logo should be 40px in height for digital applications and 1 inch in height for print to ensure readability.
Exceptions are favicons or icons for example to visualize the file type in an IDE.

### Unacceptable Modifications

- **Do not distort** the logo by stretching or squashing it
- **Do not alter** the logoâ€™s colors outside of colorways described in [Colors](#colors)
- **Do not add any effects** such as shadows, gradients, or outlines to the logo
- **Do not rotate or flip** the logo.

### Usage on the web

When embedding the official CSS logo in websites, always use the official image files provided by the CSS Next community group. Ensure the logo scales properly on different devices and screen sizes.
Use proper CSS properties like `margin`, `padding`, and `text-align` to maintain uniform positioning across layouts.
