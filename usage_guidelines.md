# CSS Logo Usage Guidelines

## 1. Primary Logo
- **Description**: The official CSS logo, created and owned by the CSS Next community group, represents the CSS community and its future-facing initiatives.
- **Font**: The logo uses the **Dinish** font, available at [Dinish Font GitHub Repository](https://github.com/playbeing/dinish).
- **Colors**: 
  - **Main Color**: `hsla(328, 100%, 45%, 1)` (a vibrant pinkish-red).
  - **Alternative Versions**: The logo can also be displayed in black on white or white on black for contrast or when color options are limited.
- **Version Representation**: The logo can include an outlined number to represent the version. This number should be clearly visible but not disrupt the overall integrity of the logo.
- **Accessibility**: The logo should always meet at least **AA WCAG contrast** requirements to ensure accessibility across digital and print media.
- **When to Use**: The primary logo should be used in all official materials representing the CSS Next community group and its initiatives, including websites, digital assets, and promotional content.

## 2. Clear Space and Sizing
- **Clear Space**: Maintain a clear space around the logo to preserve its integrity. This space should be at least equal to half the height of the logo.
- **Minimum Size**: The minimum size of the logo should be 50px in height for digital applications and 1 inch in height for print to ensure readability.

## 3. Logo Variations
- **Full-Color Version**: The main version uses `hsla(328, 100%, 45%, 1)`, suitable for light backgrounds.
- **Black and White Versions**: The logo can be shown in black on white or white on black for high-contrast situations.
- **Versioned Logos**: When using the logo with a version number, the number should appear outlined in the main color, black, or white depending on the background.

## 4. Logo Placement
- Always position the logo prominently, ensuring it’s clearly visible and does not compete with other design elements.
- **Preferred Placement**: For digital use, the top left or right corner is recommended. For print materials, it can be centered or placed where visually appropriate.

## 5. Backgrounds
- **Approved Backgrounds**: Use neutral, light, or CSS Next-approved colors that maintain at least **AA WCAG contrast** with the logo.
- **Prohibited Backgrounds**: Avoid using the logo on overly busy or complex backgrounds that reduce its legibility or fail to meet AA WCAG contrast standards.

## 6. Unacceptable Modifications
- **Do not distort** the logo by stretching or squashing it.
- **Do not alter** the logo’s colors outside of black, white, or the official CSS color (`hsla(328, 100%, 45%, 1)`).
- **Do not add any effects** such as shadows, gradients, or outlines to the logo (except for outlined version numbers when applicable).
- **Do not rotate or flip** the logo.
- **Do not combine** the CSS logo with other logos, icons, or graphics unless authorized by the community group.

## 7. Usage in CSS (Web)
- When embedding the official CSS logo in websites, always use the official image files provided by the CSS Next community group.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the logo scales properly on different devices and screen sizes.
- **Alignment**: Use proper CSS properties like `margin`, `padding`, and `text-align` to maintain uniform positioning across layouts.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the logo maintains contrast levels that meet at least AA WCAG guidelines.

## 8. File Formats
- **Preferred File Formats**: SVG and PNG for web and digital use, EPS and PDF for print.
- Use high-resolution versions to ensure clarity in all formats and sizes.

## 9. Community Approval Process
- Before using the CSS logo for any new initiative, event, or platform, seek approval from the CSS Next community group to ensure adherence to these guidelines.
